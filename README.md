# Percolation

Percolation theory describes the behavior of connected, random clusters within a domain. This program randomly seeds squares of a desired size within a square domain until the percolation threshold is reached - the point where a connected path exists from the top to the bottom of the domain.

The size of the squares is controlled via the variable 't', line 10.

Please forgive the messy code, lack of functions and structure, and overboard commenting - I made this a while ago before I knew much about programming.
